# Model Architecture

The model is built using the SRResNet and SRGAN architecture described in the paper

## Training Data

The model is trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data">ImageNet 100K Subset</a> datatset available on Kaggle

## Super Resolution Results

Following are some of the results of the model on a few royalty free images from the internet

Due to the hardware limitations, I was not able to train the models for the exact number of iterations described in the paper and I also had to take a subset of 30k images from the ImageNet dataset for the same reasons.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pillow numpy
```
2. Download the inference script located at `srgan-inference.ipynb`
3. Update the model path in the inference script, adjust image links as needed, and execute the cells.
